    "text": "Vox Populi, Vox Dei: The Rise of the Religious-Conservative Left and the Reconfiguration of Political Space in Latin America.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWhy has the Left adopted Religious Conservatism in some Latin American countries, but has failed to do so in others? While the common wisdom is that secular progressivism and left-wing parties go hand in hand in contemporary politics, some notable Latin American cases challenge this expectation. In recent years, a new type of Left has combined left-wing economic policies with religious-conservative agendas. In this project, I explain the emergence of this unexpected combination of policy packages by focusing on the strategic decisions of political actors and the constraints imposed on them by the political system. First, I claim that the weakening of economic differences between the Left and the Right led to left-wing parties prematurely adopting culturally progressive policies as a main source of differentiation. In turn, this cleavage realignment created a disconnect between the Left and part of their voters, who did not feel represented by this new culturally progressive agenda––thus creating a vacuum that new politicians could exploit. Nonetheless, I argue that the existence of political space for the mobilization of culturally conservative positions is not enough to give rise to the Religious-Conservative Left. Parties that are highly constrained by their organizations and their bonds with culturally progressive groups encounter significant obstacles to modifying their cultural agendas. In contrast, populist leaders have an advantage in applying this strategy, due to their performative style and ideological fluidity. Adopting a multi-method approach, I empirically test this theory by drawing evidence from the cases of Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay."

Intra-denominational competing identities in Chile’s constitutional process. Politics and Religion, 16(2), 301-323.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nOver the last decade, and throughout the Americas, evangelicals have strongly mobilized in defense of socially conservative agendas or against so-called “gender ideology,” sparking general and academic interest. Much less is known about progressive evangelicals. Using the unique juncture presented by the constitutional process in Chile, we study the politicization of a progressive evangelical identity and ask when these religious groups mobilize. We argue that intra-denominational competition for evangelical identity has played an important role in progressive evangelical mobilization, and more specifically the wish to differentiate themselves from conservative evangelicals, introduce a distance from the political right, and show the internal diversity of the community. This process occurs in response to an initial (conservative) politicization of religion. Drawing on campaign materials, surveys, and interviews, we provide evidence for this argument highlighting that policy preferences and theological interpretations are core differences among both groups, sparking countermobilization."
